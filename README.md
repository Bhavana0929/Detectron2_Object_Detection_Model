# Detectron2_Object_Detection_Model
In this project I am trying to replicate/implement a model like Airbnb's amentity detection model.
This is the original article from Airbnb https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fairbnb-engineering%2Famenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e

My goal is to explore different models available out there and create a model which will suite my use case here(Amenity Detection).
And also create a model which can be downloadble and usable.
